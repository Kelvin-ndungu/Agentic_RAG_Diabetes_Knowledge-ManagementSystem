        "# Document Chunking for RAG Systems\n",
        "Chunking is a critical aspect of building effective RAG systems, yet it's often where many implementations silently fail. This notebook takes a deliberate, visible approach to chunking to ensure we don't lose valuable information in the process.\n",
        "## Why Chunking Matters\n",
        "When building RAG systems, particularly for critical domains like medical literature, we need to ensure that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Chunks preserve complete information - No content should be silently truncated or lost\n",
        "2. Rich metadata is maintained - Context about document structure and hierarchy is preserved\n",
        "3. Chunk sizes match embedding model constraints - We avoid exceeding token limits\n",
        "4. Hierarchical context is retained - The relationship between sections remains clear\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Chunking Pitfalls\n",
        "Silent truncation is one of the most dangerous failure modes. Consider this scenario: you chunk medical literature by H3 headings, and one section contains 1,000 tokens. If your embedding model (such as Chroma DB's default all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model with a 256-token limit) silently truncates content beyond its capacity, you lose 744 tokens of potentially critical medical information—without any error or warning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Orphaned content occurs when chunking by headings. Text that exists between a parent heading and its first child (e.g., introductory paragraphs between an H1 and the first H2) can be lost if not explicitly handled. In hierarchical medical literature, this bridging content often contains crucial context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Context loss from overly short chunks happens when aggressive chunking breaks apart content that should be understood together, making it difficult for the embedding model to capture meaningful semantic relationships.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Exceeding model capacity can occur even after proper chunking if you retrieve too many chunks during similarity search, overwhelming your LLM's context window—especially critical when running smaller models locally with hardware constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use a Notebook for Chunking?\n",
        "This notebook approach provides visibility at every step. Rather than running a production pipeline that silently processes thousands of documents, we can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inspect chunk sizes before embedding\n",
        "- Verify that no content exceeds token limits\n",
        "- Examine orphaned sections and ensure they're properly handled\n",
        "- Validate that hierarchical context is preserved\n",
        "- Test our chunking strategy iteratively before deploying\n",
        "\n",
        "For medical literature and other critical knowledge sources, this careful, visible approach is essential. We must see our chunks before we trust them.\n",
        "Let's begin by examining our document structure and building a chunking strategy that preserves every piece of valuable information"

        "## Why I Chose Custom Chunking Over LangChain Splitters\n",
        "\n",
        "I built a custom hierarchical chunking parser instead of using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter, or other general-purpose splitters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For this medical diabetes guidelines document, we needed complete content preservation, precise citations with exact section numbers and URLs, orphan section handling (content between headings (eg h1) and first heading child(eg h2)), and intact hierarchical structure for navigation and web integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why LangChain splitters weren't suitable:**\n",
        "- Size-based splitting can break logical boundaries\n",
        "- Risk of losing orphan sections\n",
        "- Limited hierarchical metadata for precise citations\n",
        "- Generic approach doesn't match the structured needs for this document. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**When LangChain Splitters Are Appropriate**\n",
        "LangChain's splitters work well when handling diverse, unstructured documents at scale, where fixed-size chunks are acceptable and document structure is less critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our Custom Solution**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our parser respects document structure (chunks align with H1/H2/H3/H4 sections), preserves orphan sections, maintains full hierarchy with breadcrumbs, enables precise citations with section numbers and URLs, and supports web integration with generated URLs and anchors.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this single, well-structured medical document, custom chunking ensures completeness, traceability, and accurate referencing—essential for clinical guidelines."
